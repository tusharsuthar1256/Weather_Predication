# GreenCalc

GreenCalc is a React + TypeScript (TSX) web application designed to provide digital solutions for irrigation scheduling and water management in agriculture. By leveraging real-time weather data, crop-specific water requirements, and soil moisture analysis, GreenCalc helps farmers optimize irrigation practices, conserve water, and improve crop health.

## Features

* **Home Page**: Overview of GreenCalc’s goals, mission, and key features.
* **Weather Prediction**: Enter a city name to fetch weather data, irrigation timing suggestions, and recommended crops.
* **Water Consumption Calculator**: Input field area (hectares), crop type, and growing season to calculate:

  * Daily Water Need
  * Seasonal Water Need
  * Water Efficiency
  * Water consumption matrix (graphical representation)
* **Soil Moisture Calculator**: Input soil type, method of data input (manual or city-based), recent rainfall (mm), and days since last watering to determine:

  * Current Moisture Level
  * Optimal Moisture Range
  * Moisture Status and Watering Recommendation
  * Soil moisture level over time (graph)
  * Plant health status based on moisture levels

## Technology Stack

* **React** (v18+) with **TypeScript** (tsx)
* **Context API** for state management
* **Tailwind CSS** for styling (optional, adjust as needed)
* **Chart.js** or **Recharts** for graphical data visualization
* **OpenWeatherMap API** (or similar) for weather data

## Pages Overview

### 1. Home

The Home page introduces the project and outlines its objectives:

* Mission: Provide a digital irrigation scheduling tool to help farmers.
* Key benefits: Water conservation, optimized crop yields, data-driven decisions.

### 2. Weather Prediction

* **Input**: City name
* **Output**:

  * Current and forecasted weather data
  * Irrigation timing suggestions
  * Crop recommendations based on seasonal suitability

### 3. Water Consumption Calculator

* **Inputs**:

  1. Field Area (hectares)
  2. Crop Type
  3. Growing Season
* **Outputs**:

  * Daily Water Need
  * Seasonal Water Need
  * Water Efficiency
  * Graphical water consumption matrix

### 4. Soil Moisture Calculator

* **Inputs**:

  * Soil Type
  * Data input method:

    * Manual rainfall (mm)
    * City-based weather data
  * Days since last watering
* **Outputs**:

  * Current Moisture Level (e.g., 75%)
  * Optimal range (e.g., 75% - 90%)
  * Status (Optimal, Deficient, Excess)
  * Watering recommendation (e.g., next watering in 3 days)
  * Soil moisture level graph
  * Plant health indicator

## Context API Usage

GreenCalc uses the React Context API to manage global state, including:

* User-selected city for weather data
* Field and crop parameters
* Soil moisture inputs and results

This approach centralizes state management, making data accessible across pages without prop drilling.
